# Drone-Delivery-System
CSCI 3081w term-long project to create a virtual drone delivery system with a team. The system will be built form the ground-up, dealing with the physics, logistics, route planning, malfunctions, security, congestion, and cost of a real drone delivery system. This is a clone of my University github repo.
